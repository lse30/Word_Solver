Solves the letters game in 8 out of 10 cats does countdown

Ver 1.0
TO USE: simple enter you 9 given letters into the 'letters' variable on line 8. Each must have a space inbetween, 
(will make it easier to use later)


Simple tool to help find the longest possible word given 9 random letters, works for now, I've found the the english dictionary 
that it uses doesn't actually have every work in it/it doesn't match the one used on the show. 

Bit challenging to sort words when theres double letters involved but other than that it uses a simple emlimination strategy to 
reduce the dictionary until only possible words remain
